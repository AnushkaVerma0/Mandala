# Mandala
The provided Python code uses the Turtle graphics library to create a colorful mandala pattern on a black background. It defines a function called draw_mandala that uses a Turtle object to draw concentric circles with different colors, creating a visually appealing and intricate design. The mandala is constructed by repeatedly changing the pen color, drawing lines, and making circular patterns while varying the line length based on the loop index. Once the mandala is drawn, the turtle.done() function is called to finish the drawing and display the result.
